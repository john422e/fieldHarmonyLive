mainTemplate.scd gives instructions on how to run program synchronously with analyzeSampleTemplate.py

template files have defaults for # of peak freqs to be passed through, cycle durations, etc. which can be modified

both files can be copied and developed for more complex analysis, processing, and compositional forms (look to main loop in mainTemplate.scd for cycle/dur variables)
